Boosting is a method that aims to improve the performance of any supervised learning algorithm by
combining the results of several weak or base classifiers to obtain a robust final classifier.
One of the most popular Boosting techniques is the Adaptive Boosting algorithm (AdaBoost). This
algorithm, through an iterative training of the weak or base classifiers, gives greater importance to
the previously misclassified data, and in this way obtains a new classifier, Achieving better results
increasing the accuracy of the algorithm.
In the present article, with the objective of evaluating the performance of the AdaBoost algorithm,
Logistic Regression and SMO (Sequential minimal optimization) classification methods are
applied, with and without the AdaBoost algorithm to a set of texts. Then, the results obtained from
the classification methods are compared with the results considered them as the base algorithm for
AdaBoost. The classification criteria used was the gender to which the text belongs (Scientific /
Non-Scientific). The characterization of the texts is based on the frequency distribution of the
morpho-syntactic categories. The final results of the different classifiers considered are evaluated
by percentages of bad classification. It was observed that when applying AdaBoost considering the
Logistic Regression method as a basic algorithm, there was no reduction in the percentage of
misclassification. In contrast, in the case of the SMO method as a base algorithm, the percentage of
bad classification fell by 8.67%.
